Please send me an e-mail if you have found a mistake or have questions. Any feedback is appreciated.

Please evaluate the Notebook with the name "Wave Propagation AllFunctions_v5.8".
Then you can check the Example files or use the defined functions in addition to the Mathematica Built-in functions for your optical simulations.
This code is compatible with Mathematica 10 or later versions.
This program/package will be periodically updated.
